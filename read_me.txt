
To ensure that the application utilizes classes and objects effectively with clear relationships and responsibilities among them with Object-Oriented Design, the following points can be highlighted in the README file:

Class Organization: The application is organized into multiple classes such as Library, Book, User, DataManager, BookManager, and UserManager, each responsible for specific functionalities.

Encapsulation: Classes encapsulate related data and behavior, keeping them organized and manageable. For example, the Library class encapsulates book and user management operations.

Abstraction: Each class represents a real-world entity (e.g., books, users, data management), abstracting away unnecessary details and providing a clear interface for interacting with these entities.

Inheritance: The BookManager and UserManager classes inherit from the DataManager class, demonstrating inheritance to reuse common functionality and promote code reuse.

Composition: The Library class is composed of Book and User objects, illustrating composition to model complex objects from simpler ones.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a clear responsibility and performs a single well-defined task, promoting maintainability and reducing complexity.

Modularity: The application is modular, with each class focused on a specific aspect of the system (e.g., managing books, managing users, data storage), facilitating easier maintenance and updates.

Dependency Injection: The Library class interacts with Book and User objects via dependency injection, improving flexibility and testability by decoupling dependencies.

Polymorphism: Although not explicitly demonstrated in the provided code, polymorphism can be applied through method overriding or method overloading to handle different types of books or users if required in the future.

Readability and Maintainability: By adhering to Object-Oriented Design principles, the codebase is structured, understandable, and easier to maintain, supporting future enhancements and modifications effectively.

By adhering to these Object-Oriented Design principles, the application achieves a clear and maintainable structure with effective utilization of classes and objects, promoting scalability, extensibility, and code reusability.
